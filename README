This RubyGem allows Ruby Coders to access the information contained on callook.info, an online Amateur Radio Callsign Lookup service, run by Joshua Dick, W1JDD.

The gem is easy to use and should work something like this:

#!/usr/bin/ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'callsign'
call = CallSign.new("w1aw")
puts call.address


-------------------------------------------------

Well since I can't figure rdoc out, I'll tell you that CallSignRb has the following functions:

address(sep = "\n") - you can specify a separator if you don't want newlines.
name
callsign
previouscallsign
trusteecallsign
